Now, we are going to learn about bookmarks -
how to use them, how to maintain them, and also something more about the file
formats and maybe even about the code structure later. But don't fear, we
won't burden you with it, just stop reading when you already know enough.</p><p>In order to read this, you need some common sense, the ability to start ELinks
and some idea about what's a Web document, a URL address and knowledge like
that.</p><p>If we ever mention some keys here, please note that you can rebind almost any
action to another key which you like more - then you must obviously imagine
your own key in place of that. Below, we will list all actions, options and so
on related to bookmarks. We won't tell you how to rebind the keys, though;
another document will take on that.</p><p>Somewhat out-of-order, a very frequent FAQ: In order to move bookmarks around,
you need to mark them first - press <span class="emphasis"><em>Insert</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>*</em></span> (if you use the default
keymap) to do that.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2600437"></a>The Bookmark Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>Basically, almost everything is going on in the so-called bookmark manager.
That's a special dialog window, which contains a listing of all the bookmarks
you ever told ELinks to remember and it lets you to do with them anything you
would ever want to do with them.</p><p>You launch the bookmark manager by pressing the <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> key in standby (standard)
mode. You should see a big empty space (bookmarks will slowly appear there as
you will add them) and couple of buttons shriveling at the bottom. So, as a
start, move with the right (or left; both will do) arrow to the button <span class="strong"><strong>Add
bookmark</strong></span> and fill in the input fields it offers to you. I mean, you can type
something like "ELinks homepage" to the first field, then move down by e.g.
the down arrow and fill "http://elinks.cz/" to the second field. Then,
bravely press enter and watch the bookmark popping up at the top of the vast
area reserved for bookmarks.</p><p>Repeat this step few times. Now, you can move between bookmarks by the up and
down arrow, jump to the location any of them points to by the Goto button,
change it by the Edit button, delete it with the Delete button and so on. When
you'll become bored, press the escape button and you're free again!</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Hints and Odd Features </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Ancient Forests</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
