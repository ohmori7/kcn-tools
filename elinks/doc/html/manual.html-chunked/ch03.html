give an overview of how to get started and serve as an entry point to many
of the (undocumented) features of ELinks. It won't tell you all the
details, but should hopefully give you an idea of how things work and make
it possible for you to even figure out how to go further.</p><p>Although ELinks is text-based, the user interface has many of interaction
methods normally found in graphical environments. There are menus, dialogs
with buttons and hierarchic list boxes with folders. Care has been taken to
make the interaction between various dialogs consistent, so the controls
will quickly become familiar to new users.</p><p>The user interface can be controlled using both mouse and keyboard, but
currently it is only possible to configure keybindings. Looking back, the
key-controls have been more advanced than the mouse support, but during the
0.10 prereleases the mouse support has been much improved. You will now find
find stuff like contextual menus when right-clicking in different document
zones.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2599003"></a>Overview of the User Interface</h2></div></div></div><p>The main user interface of ELinks consists of the document view and dialog
bars displaying the information such as the title of the currently viewed
document, all opened tabs and the browsing status. The 3 bars are elaborated
further below.</p><p>The most important dialogs that you will meet include the Main, Link and Tab
menus and the different managers. The menus serve as entry points to the
actions available from different contexts, while the managers let you check
the state and control the various subsystems, such as loaded cookies and the
global history. The utility menus and the manager tools are investigated
further below.</p><p>The document viewer in ELinks provides a feature-rich set of ways to browse
documents. That is, multiple options exist for navigating, searching and
displaying documents and you will hopefully figure in time what works best
for you. The basic browsing possibilities are presented below.</p><p>ELinks is highly configurable, so if there is something that you would like
to change, it is most likely possible. The best overview of the many options
are given in the <code class="literal">elinks.conf(5)</code> man page.  Keybindings are discussed in the
<code class="literal">elinkskeys(5)</code> man page.  It is not always up-to-date, so you should also
check the keybinding manager and the overview of all the configured
keybindings given in the Help -&gt; Keys dialog. The Keys dialogs serves as a
good introduction to the most common keybindings.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s09.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">What User-Agent header does ELinks send? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Title, Tab and Status bar</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
