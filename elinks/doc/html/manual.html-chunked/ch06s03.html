browsing. The lifespan of document marks depends on rather ill-defined and
(for an average mortal) mostly non-deterministic technical conditions.</p><p>Generally, marks _always_ survive when not moving away from the document or
when moving only in the session history (and unhistory). That means, if you
go back and the "unback" to the document, you will find your marks safely in
place. If you follow a link from the document (or typed an address to the
Goto URL dialog) and then go back (by pressing the right arrow or through
the File menu), your marks are safe too. These are in fact by far the most
common usage cases for the marks, so most of the time it will just work as
you expect.  That's a good news.</p><p>The bad news is that in all other cases, nothing is guaranteed.  It might
work if you get back to the document by any other means (by following some
link or typing its address to the Goto URL dialog), or it might not. It
might be possible to achieve two instances of the document inside a single
ELinks, each with its own set of marks. However, again, generally it will
work as expected - this paragraph serves only as a disclaimer in cases it
doesn't.  Don't rely on it.</p><p>Marks never survive over ELinks restarts. If you quit your ELinks completely
and run it again, the marks you placed will be no more. No exceptions. Well.
In some cases, it <span class="strong"><strong>might</strong></span> appear that they survived, but that just means you
did not quit your ELinks _completely_ --- if you run multiple ELinks
instances under a single user on a single system, they "join" together and
you must quit (or kill) them all to get rid of the damn thing.  But that's a
different story.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Restrictions </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 7. URL Shortcuts in ELinks</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
