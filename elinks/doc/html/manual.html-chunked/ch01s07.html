adjust below. You can fine-tune the ELinks binary to include really only what
you want it to. It acts as a front-end to the configure script in the sense
that it is possible to control any features in this file by passing arguments
to the configure script. In fact any arguments given to the script will
overrule the values set in this file.</p><p>There are still some things which are to be adjusted only directly through the
configure script arguments though, so check ./configure —help out as well!</p><p>All dependency checking is done by the configure script so even though a
feature is enabled here it is possible that it will be disabled at compile
time if the dependencies are not met. Check the features.log file generated
by the configure script to make sure.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2596766"></a>Notes for users</h3></div></div></div><p>All features that can be controlled using this file are already set to their

once and then the client sends it back along each request to the server.  This
mechanism is crucial e.g. for keeping HTTP sessions (you "log in" to a site,
and from then on the site recognizes you usually because of the cookie), but
also for various banner systems, remembering values filled to various forms,
and so on. You can further tune the ELinks behaviour at runtime (whether to
accept/send cookies, ask for confirmation when accepting a cookie etc).</p><p>This functionality is usually quite important and you should not disable it

submit a form, offering to remember it and pre-fill it the next time. And yes,
ELinks can do that too! You will still need to also enable this manually at
document.browse.forms.show_formhist.</p><p>Many people find it extremely annoying (including pasky), however some others
consider it extremely handy and will sacrifice almost anything to get it. It
will not do any harm to have this compiled-in as long as you will leave it

You can browse through this history in the history manager (press <span class="emphasis"><em>h</em></span>).  Do
not confuse this with the "session history", recording history of your
browsing in the frame of one session (session history is the thing you move
through when pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>back</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>unback</em></span> or which you see in the
File::History menu).</p><p>Global history does not care about the order you visited the pages in, it just
records that you visited it, when did you do that and the title of the page.
Then, you can see when did you visit a link last time (and what was the title
of the target document at that time), links can be coloured as visited etc.</p><p>If you disable this feature, you will not lose any crucial functionality, just
some relatively minor convenience features, which can nevertheless prove
sometimes very practical.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Default:</strong></span>  enabled</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2597049"></a>MIME</h3></div></div></div><p>ELinks uses a MIME system for determining the content type of documents and

browsing in ELinks. This feature makes the dialog more powerful by making it
possible to extend how entered text is handled through a set of rewrite rules
(see protocol.rewrite options).</p><p>There are two types of rules: simple and smart ones.</p><p>Simple rewriting rules are basically URI abbreviations, making it possible to
map a word to the full URI. They can also be used for hierarchic navigation to
ease moving from some nested directory to the parent directory or doing other
stuff with the current URI. For example, when you type <span class="emphasis"><em>gg</em></span> into the goto
dialog, you will be materialized at Google's homepage.</p><p>Smart rules can take arguments and therefore enable more advanced rewriting.
The arguments could be search words to google for or a lookup query for a
dictionary. Eg. type <span class="emphasis"><em>gg:Petr Baudis king of ELinks cvs</em></span>.</p><p>This feature is also available in a more powerful form in the Lua and Guile
extensions, so if you plan to or already use those, you won't miss anything by
disabling this feature (besides easier and better integrated configuration).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Default:</strong></span>  enabled</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="CONFIG-BITTORRENT"></a>BitTorrent Protocol Support (<code class="literal">CONFIG_BITTORRENT</code>)</h3></div></div></div><p>The BitTorrent protocol is a protocol for distributing files in a peer-to-peer
(P2P) manner. It uses the HTTP protocol for communicating with a central
server and a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol for exchanging file pieces betweens
peer downloaders. The integrity of file pieces downloaded from peers are
checked using cryptographic hashing (SHA1).</p><p>Downloads using BitTorrent are started by first downloading a .torrent file
with the MIME type "application/x-bittorrent". The file contains information
which enables ELinks to ask a central server, called a tracker, for
information about other downloading peers and start downloading from and
uploading to them.</p><p>At any time, an external handler can always be defined to take precedence of
the internal BitTorrent client and the internal client can always be forced
by prefixing the URI of the .torrent file with "bittorrent:"</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The BitTorrent support is still experimental.</p></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Default:</strong></span>  disabled</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="CONFIG-CGI"></a>Local CGI Support (<code class="literal">CONFIG_CGI</code>)</h3></div></div></div><p>ELinks can (like w3m or lynx) execute certain executable files stored on the
local disks as CGIs, when you target it on them (through a URI of the <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>

be executed by a web server. See the protocol.file.cgi options tree for
detailed runtime configuration.</p><p>Some people just write their bookmark management application as Perl CGI
script and then access it from the web browser using this feature, not needing
any web server or so. Therefore, this is a great possible way to extended the
browser capabilities.</p><p>Even when you compile this in, you need to enable this yet in the
configuration, and even then only CGI files passing certain user-defined
filters (path-based) will be allowed to be executed (and there are certain
other security barriers in place).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Default:</strong></span>  disabled, available if setenv() or putenv() is found</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="CONFIG-DATA"></a>Data URI protocol (<code class="literal">CONFIG_DATA</code>)</h3></div></div></div><p>The data URI protocol is defined in RFC 2397 and allows inclusion of small

anonymous archives. FSP protocol is valuable in all kinds of environments

this arrangement, users do not need an account on the server. By default,
the account name for the anonymous access is <span class="emphasis"><em>anonymous</em></span>. This account
does not need a password, but users are commonly asked to send their email
addresses as their passwords for authentication (protocol.ftp.anon_passwd),

designed for the Internet in RFC 1436. The need for gopher arose in in the
early days of the hypertext Internet where the number of documents that were
being published in campus and research environments could not easily be
distributed using known protocols like FTP because these documents were stored
not in one place, but in many computers connected to the Internet.</p><p>The support works much like local file browsing with directories (aka. menus)

will need to install Samba (or at least just the smbclient part, if you can
install it separately).</p><p>Unfortunately, ELinks doesn't yet properly validate the file name passed to
smbclient, and this caused vulnerability CVE-2006-5925 (bug 841).  To close
the vulnerability, configure.in now disables the SMB protocol regardless

important information is _where_ did it crash. Usually, users do not have gdb
installed and can't provide a back-trace. However, ELinks can print a
back-trace on its own, if the system supports it (currently, it is implemented
only for glibc). It is not always accurate, it is useless when the ELinks
binary is stripped and it still misses a lot of important information, but it
