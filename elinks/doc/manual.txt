The ELinks Manual
=================

Preface
-------

Welcome!  This is the entry point for the humble ELinks manual.  It is by no
means complete, it is not even very homogeneous and it should eventually be
superseded by a complete ELinks Book. Until this happens you may also find it
necessary to refer to the manual page for a very quick reference, or the
built-in documentation available via the --long-help and --config-help ELinks
command-line arguments. The built-in documentation is sure to be up-to-date.

There was a complete (or, for the most part complete) manual for Links 0.82 at
one time, and you can still find it at:

 - http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/index.html[]

While large parts of it do not apply anymore, you may still find some relevant
information there.

Authors:

- Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk>

- Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>
- Miciah Dashiel Butler Masters <miciah@myrealbox.com>
