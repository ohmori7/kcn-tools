This program generate proxy.py - a tool for developers to find bugs offline.
How to use it:
1) make the change in src/network/socket.c and recompile the ELinks
/* To enable logging of tranfers, for debugging purposes. */
#if 0
^^^^^
set this to 1

2) set connection.max_connections = 1
   set connection.max_connections_to_host = 1

3) run the ELinks and gather data.

4) revert "#if 1 change" and recompile ELinks.

5) run make in directory with this file. The proxy.py should be generated
and some files with .txt extension.

6) run proxy.py

7) run ELinks and set protocol.http.proxy = localhost:8000

8) repeat previous session, go to the same pages, etc.

If you want to use https use browser scripting to replace
'https' with 'http' in follow_url.

Enjoy,
Witek
