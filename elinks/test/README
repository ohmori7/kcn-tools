This directory contains various weird documents for testing whether we're
parsing and rendering them properly. Frequently, documents are getting added
here when we implement feature needed for their correct presentation or fix bug
occuring inside of these documents. No automated testsuite yet, though.

Possible meaningful content of the documents is completely irrelevant and you
should ignore it. Noone takes any responsibility for it :).
